# Real-Time Instrument Chord to MIDI Transcriber

This project listens to live instrument input, uses Spotifyâ€™s [Basic Pitch](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch) to transcribe notes, infers the underlying harmony, and sends it as MIDI messages to a virtual MIDI port (e.g., for use in Ableton Live, Logic, any DAW).

Ideal for triggering synth pads or harmonies live with your instrument.

---

## How It Works

- Captures audio from your instrument in real time.
- Transcribes pitches using the **Basic Pitch** deep learning model.
- From the pitches it derives which chord if any is being played.
- Sends the detected chord via **MIDI** to an IAC virtual port.
- Allows you to drive instruments in DAWs like **Ableton Live** with your instrument.

---

## Requirements

- Virtual midi ports **IAC Driver** enabled (for virtual MIDI ports).
- Conda (recommended for managing Python version).
- Ableton Live or any DAW that can receive MIDI.

---

## Setup (Python 3.10 via Conda)

```bash
conda create -n ENV_NAME python=3.10
conda activate ENV_NAME

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Set Up MIDI Routing (MacOS)

1. Open **Audio MIDI Setup** â†’ **MIDI Studio**.
2. Enable the **IAC Driver**.
3. Connect your bus as a MIDI input on a track with a synth/pad.

---

## Run the App

```bash
python frontend.py
```

Open port 7680 in your browser to see the transcribed chords.

Youâ€™ll see "Listening..." in the terminal. Start playing your instrument â€” MIDI notes will be sent as chords to your MIDI-bus/DAW.
