# Real-Time instrument Chord to MIDI Transcriber

This project listens to live instrument input, uses Spotify‚Äôs [Basic Pitch](https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch) to transcribe notes, and sends them as MIDI messages to a virtual MIDI port (e.g., for use in Ableton Live).

Ideal for triggering synth pads or harmonies live with your instrument.

---

## How It Works

- Captures audio from your instrument in real time.
- Transcribes pitches using the **Basic Pitch** deep learning model.
- Sends detected notes via **MIDI** to an IAC virtual port on macOS.
- Allows you to drive instruments in DAWs like **Ableton Live** with your instrument.

---

## Requirements

- macOS with **IAC Driver** enabled (for virtual MIDI ports).
- Conda (recommended for managing Python version).
- Ableton Live or any DAW that can receive MIDI.

---

## Setup (Python 3.10 via Conda)

```bash
conda create -n instrument-midi python=3.10
conda activate instrument-midi

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Set Up MIDI Routing

1. Open **Audio MIDI Setup** ‚Üí **MIDI Studio**.
2. Enable the **IAC Driver**.
3. Create a port named `ML_listening`.
4. In **Ableton Live**, set `ML_listening` as a MIDI input on a track with a synth/pad.

---

## Run the App

```bash
python frontend.py
```

Open port 7680 in your browser to see the transcribed chords.

You‚Äôll see "Listening..." in the terminal. Start playing your instrument ‚Äî MIDI notes will be sent as chords to your DAW.
